// You are given an array of positive or negative integers (no 0). If a number n is positive,
// then move forward n steps. If n is negative, then move backwards n steps. Assume the first
// element wraps ahead of the last element, and the last element wraps behind the first element.
// Starting at index 0, determine if there is a loop in the array. Something is considered a loop
// if it starts and ends at a certain index, and has MORE THAN 1 element. The loop must go
// either 'forward' or 'backwards'.
// Example: [2, -1, 1, 2, 2] has a loop: index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0
// Example: [-1 2] has no loop
// O(n) time complexity; O(1) space complexity

var circularArrayLoop = arr => { // returns a boolean value
