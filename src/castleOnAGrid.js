/*
** You are given a N x N grid or matrix, with a start (castle) and end coordinate. Write a function that
** will calculate the minimum number of steps to move the castle from the start to the end.
** The castle can move to any coordinate in one move if there is a clear straight path. Some cells 
** on the grid are forbidden and the castle cannot cross/touch them.
** Forbidden cells are denoted as 0. Allowed cells are denoted as 1.
**
** EXAMPLE
** var grid = [
**  [1, 0, 1],
**  [1, 0, 1],
**  [1, 1, 1],
** ];
** Start coordinate (0,0). End coordinate (2, 0).
** Output: 3. (The path goes from (0,0) -> (2, 0) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 0))
