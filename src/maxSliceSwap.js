// Given an array, find the maximum sum from the set of subarrays after performing a single swap (or no swap).

/*
** Example
** [-3, 5, -2, 3, 4, -2, 3] should be 15 because you swap 5 with second -2
** [-3, 5, -2, 3, 4, -1, -2, 3] should be 14 because you swap 5 with second -2
** [-3, 5, -2, 3, -4, 4, -2, 3] should be 13 because you swap 5 with -4
** [1, 1, 5, 2, -2, -2] should be 9. No swaps are required
